# HH-Panoptica
Panoptica data for BattleScribe and NewRecruit. Not endorsed by the BSData organisation or the Panoptica team, nor is it official in any capacity to either organisation, in any measure.

This is a work in progress and subject to change. This is not intended for widespread use, although if it's helpful to you, please feel free to use it. 

This is a personal project by myself strictly for the purpose of my local Horus Heresy community. In other words, I got sick of not having a list builder for my Questoris Knights so I did  it myself and shared it with my friends, and I'll probably get roped into doing other stuff as well. 

This readme will become more informative in a near future revision.

This is a derivative work from the BSData organisation, updated to include the changes in Panoptica. All credit to the BSData organisation, the Panoptica team, and ultimately Games Workshop for all of their work on and around the Horus Heresy: Age of Darkness.
